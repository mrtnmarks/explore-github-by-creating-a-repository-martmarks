MARTIN MARKS

My name is Martin Marks, and I attend Madonna University. I love playing soccer and have played for about 18 years and currently play for my university.
I am from Argentina and speak fluent spanish. Some of my hobbies include soccer, watching soccer, and being apart of soccer in some way, if im not playing.

I took a coding calss in high school and ever since my intrest in creating things with coding flourished. Creating programs, algorithm, or anything your mind wants, to no limit, only to your knowledges' limit,
is something that made me see computer science as the most unique job oopportunity out there. Not only that but also the satisfaction of creating something by your own and it working is one of a kind.
